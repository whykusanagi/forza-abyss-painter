## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| OS | Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit |
| Game | Forza Horizon 6 |
| Disk | ~150 MB free |
| Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable | Usually already installed. If FD6 fails to launch, get it [here](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) |

**Running from source** instead of the EXE additionally needs:
- Python 3.10+
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` (installs PySide6, NumPy, Pillow, PyInstaller, pytest)

---

## Install

1. Download `FD6.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/tokyubevoxelverse/ForzaDesigner6/releases).
2. Double-click it. No installer, no admin rights.
3. Windows SmartScreen may warn the first time — click "More info" → "Run anyway".

## How to use

### A. Generate the shapes file

1. Launch `FD6.exe`.
2. Click **Upload Image…** and pick any JPEG/PNG.
3. In the **Settings** panel (right side):
   - Pick a **Profile** (`balanced` recommended).
   - Set **Stop at shapes** to your target (e.g. `1500` or `3000`).
4. Click **Start**. Watch the live preview rebuild your image.
5. When done, the `.json` is auto-saved next to your image. Click **Download JSON** if you want a copy elsewhere.

### B. Inject into Forza Horizon 6

1. Open **Forza Horizon 6** and open the **Vinyl Group editor**.
2. Load (or create) a template vinyl group with **at least N spheres**, where N = the shape count of your JSON. Tip: keep one or two reusable templates (1500-sphere and 3000-sphere) saved.
3. In FD6, click **Upload JSON** and pick your generated `.json`.
4. A modal dialog appears with live progress:
   - **Scanning FH6 memory** — 5–8 min first time per game session, seconds on later injections.
   - **Writing shapes** — ~10–30 sec.
5. When the status turns 🟢 green, close the dialog and check FH6 — your image is now the vinyl group.

---

## ✅ Do

- Open FH6 and the vinyl editor **before** clicking Inject.
- Keep at least one template vinyl group saved (sphere count ≥ your largest JSON).
- Let the injection finish — wait for the green status.
- Re-use the same JSON to re-inject if you mess up — generation only needs to happen once per image.
- Edit your vinyl group freely **between** injections.

## ❌ Don't

- **Don't edit, add, delete, or move any shape in FH6 during an active injection.** The dialog warns you. Editing reallocates the vinyl group's memory mid-write and the injection will fail. (Won't crash the game — just retry.)
- Don't close FH6 mid-injection.
- Don't run FD6 with admin rights "just in case" — it doesn't need them and may behave differently.
- Don't share your generated JSONs publicly without context — community etiquette: credit the source image.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Splash video hangs | Click anywhere or press Esc to skip. Hard 30-second auto-skip is always active. |
| "Patterns file not populated" warning on Inject | The `fh6_patterns.json` file was edited or corrupted. Restore it from the Git repo. |
| Inject finds 0 shape structs | FH6 patched and the vtable RVA shifted. See [Re-derive RVA](#re-derive-rva-after-an-fh6-update) below. |
| Inject says "template has X slots but JSON has Y" | Your template vinyl group doesn't have enough spheres. Load a bigger template. |
| Shapes appear offset / wrong scale | Known: FD6 currently writes raw pixel coords; FH6's canvas may use different units. Open an issue with a screenshot. |
| FH6 crashes after Inject | Should not happen — file an issue with your FH6 version and the JSON used. |

### Re-derive RVA after an FH6 update

The vtable RVA in `fd6/inject/patterns/fh6_patterns.json` is tied to a specific FH6 build. If a patch shifts it:

```powershell
# With FH6 open, vinyl editor active, one sphere placed at a known X coordinate:
python -m fd6.inject scan-float <known X>
python -m fd6.inject narrow <moved X>      # repeat until 1 hit
python -m fd6.inject dump <addr> 256
# vtable address = <addr> - 0x10  (struct start is 0x10 before the X field)
# new RVA = vtable_address - forzahorizon6.exe module base
# Edit anchor.vtable_rva in fh6_patterns.json with the new value (hex string, e.g. "0x6815CF8")
```

---

## Build from source

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/tokyubevoxelverse/ForzaDesigner6.git
cd ForzaDesigner6
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run from source:
python -m fd6

# Run tests:
pytest

# Build the single-file EXE:
.\build_exe.bat        # → dist\FD6.exe
```
