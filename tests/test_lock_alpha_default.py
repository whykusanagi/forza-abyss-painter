"""Regression test pinning LOCK_ALPHA=True everywhere — across every production preset
AND as the builder's defensive setdefault.

WHY THIS MATTERS: the in-game injector forces binary alpha (255) at write time. A
JSON generated with soft alpha (e.g. 96/160/255 levels) renders one way in the
notebook's engine preview and ANOTHER way in-game — the contract breaks. Every
preset must lock alpha. Every NEW preset added in the future must also lock alpha,
even if the author forgets to set the field explicitly. The builder's `setdefault`
is the safety net for that.

This test was added in v0.1.6 after the user reported the multi-shape eval presets
(shapes_highres_3000, shapes_medium_1000) were shipping with LOCK_ALPHA=False because
they were missing the field in presets.py and falling through to setdefault(False).
Two simultaneous fixes: explicit True in those presets + flipped setdefault default.
