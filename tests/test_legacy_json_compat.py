"""Compat tests for the legacy geometrize / forza-painter JSON format.

We accept two top-level shapes for `Upload JSON` in the EXE:
  1. Our native `fd6.shapes` format
  2. The legacy painter format (no `format` key, integer shape types,
     `data` arrays for geometry)

The legacy format is what `forza-painter`, geometrize-lib, and earlier
upstream-ForzaDesigner6 outputs produce. Without compat support a user
with a pre-existing painter JSON (eg shared by a friend or downloaded
from a community pack) gets a hard "Unsupported document format" error
when they Upload JSON in our EXE — which is exactly the regression
that drove this work (erebus's chibi nihilister.1000.json).
