"""QObject worker that spawns torch_runner as a subprocess and streams
its stderr line-by-line as Qt signals.

Separated from generate_dialog.py so unit tests can exercise the IPC
protocol parsing + cancel path + error routing without spinning up the
full GenerateLocallyDialog GUI on every assertion.

## Flow

  1. EXE-side GenerateLocallyDialog builds a config JSON, writes to disk
  2. Constructs GpuGenWorker(config_path) + QThread, moves worker to thread
  3. Connects signals (started / progress / done / error) to dialog slots
  4. starts the thread → worker spawns the subprocess, reads stderr loop
  5. Subprocess emits JSON-per-line events → worker parses + emits Qt signals
  6. On 'done' event, output_path lands in config; dialog reads via load_json
  7. On 'error' event, dialog surfaces a modal + leaves itself open

## Cancel path

GpuGenWorker.cancel() is a Qt slot — call from the GUI thread to flip
an atomic flag + SIGTERM the subprocess. The reader loop checks the flag
between every readline, exits cleanly, the thread.quit() chain fires
finished signals in order. SIGTERM lets torch_runner do its own cleanup
(no orphaned temp files if it was mid-save).
