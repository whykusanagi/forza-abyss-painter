"""QObject worker that runs torch_installer.install_runtime() on a
background QThread + emits progress through Qt signals.

Separated from runtime_install_dialog.py so unit tests can exercise
the worker's signal routing without spinning the dialog GUI.

## Why a worker thread

install_runtime() takes 5-15 minutes (mostly downloading + pip
installing torch + numpy dep wheels, ~3 GiB total). Running it on the
GUI thread freezes the EXE for the duration — users would conclude
the app crashed and force-kill it. The worker thread keeps the UI
responsive: progress bar updates, status label refreshes, Cancel
button stays clickable.

## Flow

  1. RuntimeInstallDialog._on_install_clicked switches the dialog to
     install-phase UI (progress bar visible, status label active)
  2. Constructs GpuInstallWorker + QThread, moves worker to thread
  3. Connects signals (progress / done / error / finished) to dialog slots
  4. Starts thread → worker calls install_runtime with progress_cb
  5. Each install_runtime phase fires progress_cb(percent, status)
     which the worker forwards to the progress Qt signal
  6. On success → done(RuntimeInfo dict), dialog accepts
  7. On failure → error(stage, message), dialog shows modal + closes

## Cancel

Currently NOT supported mid-install. install_runtime is synchronous
and not designed to interrupt cleanly mid-download. The Cancel
button during install just disables itself until done. Future
improvement: structured cancellation via a shared flag the urlretrieve
hook checks. For now, the user can manually delete the runtime dir
after the dialog closes.
