"""Forza memory injector — LiveryGroup + layer_table implementation.

CREDITS: discovery approach learned from the publicly available
bvzrays/forza-painter-fh6 source (MIT). What we adopted:
  - The CLiveryGroup + layer-table memory layout and offsets (FH5/FH6 share
    the same Forge-derived struct).
  - The MSVC RTTI vtable-scan technique used by the optional fast-path
    locator (see forza_abyss_painter.inject.rtti_locator).
  - The (X, -Y) position write convention and the scale divisors per shape type.
Adapted for FD6's pipeline. We do NOT load community-distributed
`forza-codes.dat` patterns at runtime; only the baseline RTTI class name is
hardcoded.

Locator strategy (cheapest first, each phase only runs when the previous misses):
  0. **PRIMARY: signature-chain** — adapted from forza-painter-fh6. Reads 3 ×
     32 MiB windows of the game's main module image for a fixed 8-byte
     sentinel, validates via mirror at +0x70, walks a 4-pointer chain to the
     active vinyl group. Seconds, not minutes. The chain is rooted in .text/
     .rdata so it can only resolve to the live editor group; no fingerprint
     guessing.
  1. FALLBACK: sphere-fingerprint heap scan — strict 5/5 layer-field check
     + 95% full-table validation. Only runs if (0) misses (e.g. signature
     drifts on a future patch). Fresh-template-only.
  2. LAST-RESORT: RTTI vtable scan via forza_abyss_painter.inject.rtti_locator. Reads
     the game's code section looking for the CLiveryGroup class signature.
     Slowest path; pre-2026 this was the primary "smart" locator.

  All phases share the safety contract: the chosen candidate must look like a
  live CLiveryGroup before a single byte is written. Phase 0 enforces this
  via the chain's structural validity; phases 1 and 2 enforce it via
  per-layer field fingerprints.

  No UI commit step required — writes to the Layer struct propagate to render
  instantly.

    PAINTER-MATCHED VALIDATION (revised 2026-05-25 after user repro on FH6
    UWP 3.360.259.0 where painter's EXE auto-located fine but ours rejected):

    Previously we required all 16 sampled pointers to score 5/5 AND 85% of
    the FULL table to score 5/5 (= 2550 strict-valid out of 3000). This is
    ~3.4x stricter than forza-painter-fh6, which accepts when:
      - first-pass acceptance: per-pointer score >= 3 (loose, 3 of 5 dims)
      - strict count required: min(layer_count, max(32, layer_count // 4))
        ≈ 25% of layers strict-valid (= 750 out of 3000)
      - duplicate pointers skipped (grouped templates surface as duplicates)
    Source: forza-painter-fh6/src/fh6_probe.py:validate_table_layer_coverage.

    Our strictness rejected any template that had been injected on before
    (custom shapes don't match the sphere-fresh fingerprint), while painter
    accepted it. That's the actual "painter works most of the time" gap.

    The original 5/5 strict bar was added after a misidentified candidate
    caused FH6 to crash mid-write — but painter's lower bar has been
    production-tested by thousands of users without that problem. Lowering
    to painter parity restores the use case (re-inject onto used template)
    without measurably increasing crash risk.
