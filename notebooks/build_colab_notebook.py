This notebook runs the Forza Abyss Painter GPU shape-generator on CUDA.
It mirrors the desktop CLI (`forza_abyss_painter.cli.oneshot`) but is self-contained — no clone, no install
beyond the pre-installed Colab stack.

**Before running:** switch the runtime to a GPU.
> Runtime → Change runtime type → Hardware accelerator: **GPU** (T4 is fine; V100/A100 is faster)

**Workflow:**
1. Run the *Setup* cell (verifies CUDA, defines the engine).
2. Run the *Upload* cell and pick a PNG/JPG. For stickers (RGBA with transparency you want
   preserved), set `STICKER_MODE=True` in the *Run* cell.
3. Run the *Run* cell — it generates shapes and writes `<stem>_<NUM_SHAPES>.json`
   + `<stem>_<NUM_SHAPES>_render.png` so you can tell at a glance which budget tier this
   JSON belongs to (eg `my_image_3000.json` = high-detail vs `my_image_400.json` = lineart).
4. The result is displayed inline. Download the JSON to ship to your Windows FH6 injector.

**If you hit a CUDA OOM:** run the **Cleanup** cell (Section 3) and lower `RANDOM_SAMPLES`
or `MUTATIONS_PER_ROUND`. Memory cost scales as `K * H * W * 12 bytes` per intermediate,
with 2-3 intermediates live. Restart runtime if the cleanup cell can't get allocation under
~10 GB.
